# Gevel-Configurator
Gevel Configurator project voor Stichting Happy Balance

## Installation
First off you'll need to download [Unity Hub & Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).  

Once those are installed its time to clone this repository into your desired folder. 
Next you start up Unity Hub and follow any necessary instructions until you arrive at an empty Projects screen.

Click on [ ADD ] to open a project existing on your computer.

This will open a 'Select a project to open...' panel in which you will select the highlighted folder inside the cloned repository to open the Unity3D project.

## Running the Application

After you've followed the previous steps you'll be ready to open the project.  

The first time you open the project you might be greeted with an empty screen without any scenes loaded. 
To populate the Scene drag a Unity Scene from the Assets/Scenes folder into the Hierarchy tab. The most up to date scene should be main.unity .  

To build and run the application you first need to set the desired build folder. To access the build settings see picture below. 

<details open>
<summary>File/Build Settings</summary>

</details>  

This will open the following menu.

</details>  

Press the [ Build ] button and a 'Build Windows' panel will open. Select the highlighted folder inside the repository folder. If this folder does not exist create a folder with the name B/build. Folders with this name will be ignored and not uploaded to Github.

After Selecting the build folder the application will begin building and saving into the target folder. The application can now be run by executing the 'Gevel Configurator.exe' inside the build folder. 

###### PS. Make sure there are no errors otherwise the application can not be build. Errors sometimes only arise when trying to build so do this regularly.
